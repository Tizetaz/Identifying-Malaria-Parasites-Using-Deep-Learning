**Problem Statement**

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected Female Anopheles Mosquitoes. In 2019 an estimated 229 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide and 409,000 people died. Microscopic detection of malarial parasites is generally considered as a ‘gold standard’ in malaria diagnosis that requires an expert microscopist. Such diagnosis is sensitive,  laborious and sometimes unreliable especially  in case of lack of expertise. In response to this problem, this project tries to identify and classify malaria on blood smear slide images by using  deep learning methodologies with the aim of automating the process.

**Data Source**

The Malaria Dataset used is collected by researchers at the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications (LHNCBC), which contains a total of 27,558 cell images from the blood smear slide images of segmented cells. Then, these images were manually annotated as healthy and infected blood smear images by an expert slide reader at the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Bangkok, Thailand.
Objective
The analysis is aimed to test:

- Identify malaria infected cells from a given image dataset
- Evaluate model performance
**Method**
To serve the purpose of differentiating infected (malaria) and uninfected cells from the microscopic blood smear images, Deep Learning techniques particularly Convolutional and Artificial Neural Network will be used. Other methodologies include:
Data pre-processing and transformation 
Setting up processing environment for Deep Learning (e.g.Graphical Processing Unit)
Using Tensorflow and Keras as a Deep Learning framework with a python implementation
Training and optimizing (as needed) of Convolutional Neural Network model for malaria parasite detection in single cells using the Malaria Dataset
Evaluating the performance of the model on a test set.

**Target Audience:**
Various stakeholders can be benefited from such projects either by directly involved or affected by the operations of organizations working to prevent and treat malaria. To list some, health care systems; local, national and international organizations; manufacturers of malaria drugs and vaccines; advocacy and educational groups as well as partnering agencies that fund malaria programs.

**Challenges**
The main challenges of Deep Learning are the fact that they need large amounts of training data, are expensive in terms of the computational resources they require as well as their time consuming nature to configure and execute the process. These issues will be anticipated to be the major challenges for this project.
